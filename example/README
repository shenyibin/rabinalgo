HOW TO COMPILE THIS EXAMPLE 
---------------------------
After compiling the rabinpoly library (i.e., do make in the top directory)
do 'make' in this directory. You don't have to install the rabinpoly library
as long as you have the compiled library librabinpoly.a in ../src. 

This will create an executable, example1. 


HOW TO RUN
----------
Let's try the following command.

> example1 testfile 16

What this does is to read "testfile" and compute rabin fingerprints
while reading the bytes in the testfile one by one. The sliding window
size we use in this example is 16. 


MORE DETAIL
-----------
Let's look at the source code, example1.cpp.
The only thing you need to look at is, how I used the rabinpoly class,
"window". 

  // Initialize the class
  window myRabin(FINGERPRINT_PT, windowsize);
  
  // Supply a byte, and get the rabin fingerprint of the current sliding window
  rabinf = myRabin.slide8(buf[i]);

  // The 'window' class holds the bytes in the sliding window. 
  // If you want to reset the data structure and empty the buffer, just do
  myRbin.reset();
